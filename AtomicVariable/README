AtomicVariable is an atomic implementation for a variable.
It is very similar in concept with Java-built-in AtomicReference.
AtomicVariable allows more flexible atomic operation to the variable.

For example, AtomicReference has method compareAndSet(...)
  which will compare the expected object to the object held by the reference.
The comparison is done by calling equals(...) method.
However, many times, I found myself needing to compare with more complicate logic.
For example, check if the last modify field of the object is older than expected.
This can't be done with AtomicVariable.

Another example is the lazy evaluation of the value to be set.
AtomicVariable has checkBeforeUpdate(...) method
  which allows the new value to be determined by the current value ONLY
    when the current value is checked to be as expected. 

AtomicVariable is a project as part of JPaperCuts which contains tiny projects
  that solve small problems.
